# 🎯 AI-Powered Circuit Debugging and Design Assistant

Welcome to my IBM Cloud project repository! This project is part of the **Agentic AI Challenge under Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering**, where I designed an **AI-powered assistant** that helps users diagnose and optimize analog audio circuits such as filters, amplifiers, and preamps.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Analog audio circuits are critical in communication and sound systems. However, designing and troubleshooting them often involves deep domain expertise and time-consuming debugging. This project solves that by using **IBM’s AI services** to build an intelligent virtual assistant that can:

- Understand technical user queries
- Provide circuit design tips
- Detect common issues (e.g., noise, distortion, grounding)
- Suggest component-level improvements
